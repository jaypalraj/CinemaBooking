# CinemaBooking
A simple web app that lets users book/buy cinema tickets, the UI is a pure ASP.NET Core web app with no use of any front end javascripts libraries.

It uses Microsoft Azure service bus to handle messages, when tickets are booked.

On completion of the ASP.NET Core UI, the next phase is to add another UI Layer using Angular 7
